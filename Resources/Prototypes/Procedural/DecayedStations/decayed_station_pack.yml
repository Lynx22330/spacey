# This is an attempt to get a destroyed version of a full station map ported to the dungen packs.
# To make this work I need to set the size to something large that fits station dimensions.
# THESE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE ANY OFFSET DESTRUCTION, I.E. Unconnected grids / debri flung around, everything should orient southward.

# Using 100,100 x and y dimensions to generate over 1000 tiles inside of one large square.
# This is where the base area is defined, as in, maps will generate within these tiles provided. Must have a 'preset' that fits within the bounds. For example,
# anything that is under 20x20 can work in StationArea0, yet anything over 20x20 will not work. The generator will pick the largest tileset to use within
# the preset during dungeon generation.
