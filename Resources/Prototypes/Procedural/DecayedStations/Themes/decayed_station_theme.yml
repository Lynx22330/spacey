# This is where you define the room "areas" within the map itself. Meaning if you wanted this to be used, you need to first define
# an area, then a preset, then a pack that can use the preset, which can then use the area defined here.
# When creating a new map follow this guide, Area comes first (This .yml), a Preset size that can use the given areas,
# then a Pack that is big enough to fit the presets that are set.
# For even more clarity... You can have 20 Areas, with 4 preset sizes that can be used inside of a Pack that can contain 2 or more zones to generate inside of.
