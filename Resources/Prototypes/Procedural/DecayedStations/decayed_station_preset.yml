# This is an attempt to get a destroyed version of a full station map ported to the dungen packs.
# To make this work I need to set the size to something large that fits station dimensions.
# THESE SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE ANY OFFSET DESTRUCTION, I.E. Unconnected grids / debri flung around, everything should orient southward.

# Set to 100 to fit the station preset inside.
# This is where the presets are defined, the areas that can be used within the 'pack'.
